description: "Follicle mites, as they are commonly known, are distant relatives of spiders. They eat our dead skin cells, or maybe the oils, bacteria, and fungi on our skin, and they are, I should quickly add, utterly harmless. It's even possible they perform some sort of housekeeping service, making us mutually beneficial: We give them habitat, they minimize zits."
